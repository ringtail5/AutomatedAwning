# AutomatedAwning
A software and hardware combined project to automate the extension and retraction of an awning over my back porch.  
The project started as a three position switch attached to a bi-directional motor to reduce effort putting out the awning to prevent my puppies from burning their paws.
It then evolved into a python script placed on a Raspberry Pi 3B with an AC/DC switch.
Its current state is a python web server on the Raspberry Pi that allows a local website to interact with the python script.
